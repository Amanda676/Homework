In 6 with the subquery, I'm not entirely sure what is going on, but it looks 
like the inventory and film tables are hashed together twice.  Film and
inventory are scannned twice.

In 7 with the join, there is a nested loop inner join that seems to be an extra step
 in the graphical analysis (extra node). Film and inventory are scanned twice.
There is an extra node, and this looks like more computational work.
 
However, 7 took less time than 6 and I have no idea why.  I ran both a few times
got different times for each - they were rather close to each other.

10.	In under 100 words, explain what the difference is between 
set-based and procedural programming. 
Be sure to specify which sql and python are. 

Python is procedural programming and SQL is set-based programming.
In procedural programming, the language is telling the computer how to get
something (a set of procedures or instructions).  In set based programming,
the language tells us about the result or what to do and much less,
if any, about the how to get it done.  The database figures out the best way
to get the information.
